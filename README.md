#  Quantum Artificial Intelligence with Qiskit

This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Quantum Artificial Intelligence with Qiskit. It contains the example code of my  CRC Press/Taylor & Francis book, Quantum Artificial Intelligence, Andreas Wichert, 2024

Qiskit is an open-source software development kit (SDK) for working with quantum computers at the level of circuits and algorithms,  IBM Quantum,   https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/.

You can find installation instruction for qiskit at the site:
 https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html

The notebooks use some basic commands and should be compatible with different qiskit versions. One exception is the notebook 23_HybridApproaches-VariationalClassification (last example in the notebook). There are three versions, the version new should run the newes quskit version.
